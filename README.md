Nice.js extends JS syntax
=======

### You create less code. Code looks better


I worked last years with **python** language. And when I tried to switch to node.js and create both backed and frontend on **JavaScript** only - I found that JS lacks some cool features from other part of the World.

In this project I implement compiler from Nice.js syntax to plain JavaScript *(now on python, but in near future - on JS)*. I believe that you are using [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org) to simplify your coding life. I also use it, and in resulting code you will see `_()` syntax.

Resulting code is readable like your original code on Nice.js. We transform only short forms of code to full form of plain JS.

And the greatest part of this project that you can use [classes](/tests/classes.js) like in other OOP languages.

### Syntax

You can find syntax description in folder [tests](/tests).

This is part of them:
 * [classes](/tests/classes.js) - `class MyClass extends BaseClass {...}`
 * [conditions](/tests/conditions.js) - `if (10 not in list)` or `if (a == b or c and d)`
 * [loops](/tests/loops.js) - `for (x, y in obj)` and `[year for year in years if year <= 30]`
 * [etc](/tests)
